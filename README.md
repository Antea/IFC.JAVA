# IFC.JAVA

## What?
This is a JAVA class library for IFC. I only contains all the classes provided for IFC as well, so they can be used for working with IFC data in JAVA. 
The project is developed using maven, and the resulting artefact is published in the open maven repository.
The code allows serialising and deserialising IFC objects to XML and JSON. IFC-SPF (STEP) is not supported.
The code currently only contains the classes specified in IFC4 Add2.
